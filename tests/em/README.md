# Engineering Model

The OPS-SAT Engineering Model (EM), also called the FlatSat, is a hardware testbed that offers a fully representative platform to validate experiments on the ground before uplink to the real satellite. Experiment sessions on the EM are coordinated with the Flight Control Team (FCT) and closely monitored. When deploying and testing on the target ARM architecture, performance bottlenecks can be examined as well as dependencies on the embedded system to test compatibility and compliance for a successful run in orbit. In addition to normal telemetry, granular system level metrics are collected on-board using the `collectd` package. The test-deployment on the EM also contains the test-data which are a combination of raw data from the validation and test datasets, but also recordings from orbit generated by the Software Defined Radio (SDR) In-Orbit Demonstration (IOD) in June 2021.

## Get started
Simple instructions to get started. These are instructions for Windows but it's as straightforward on other operating systems.

python3 -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Follow [these instructions](https://stackoverflow.com/a/18533754) in case of the following error on Windows:
